A recreation of a previous app, now using ReactJS

This app uses Firebase's Could Firestore as a database...

As this is my first react app, obviously it has a lot of things to improve but most importantly it has a bug on toggling book's read status. I will come back to fix this issue when I finish TheOdinProject curriculum and dive more into react.
